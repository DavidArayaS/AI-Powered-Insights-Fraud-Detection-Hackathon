🛡️ Securing Your Azure & Fabric Environment: Defender for Cloud & Microsoft Fabric Security

Security in Azure and Microsoft Fabric is crucial for ensuring data integrity, compliance, and resilience against cyber threats. 

This guide provides a simple yet effective approach to monitor and improve your security posture using Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Fabric security principles.

🔹 Part 1: Enhancing Azure Security with Defender for Cloud

🎯 Step 1: Access Defender for Cloud

1️⃣ Log in to Azure Portal → Search for Defender for Cloud.
2️⃣ Navigate to Environment Settings.
3️⃣ Find the subscription where your fraud detection solution is deployed.

🎯 Step 2: Enable Security Features
📌 Turn on the following Defender Plans to secure your workloads:

✅ Foundational CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) - Free Benefit

Helps identify misconfigurations & security risks.
Provides security recommendations for Azure resources.
✅ Defender for Storage

Protects against ransomware, unauthorized access, and data exfiltration.
✅ Defender for AI Workloads

Detects anomalous behavior in AI models and workloads.
Provides real-time monitoring for OpenAI & ML models.
✅ Defender for Key Vault

Prevents unauthorized access to secrets, certificates, and keys.
🎯 Step 3: Check Your Security Posture Score
🔍 Go to Security Posture → View your Secure Score.

🛠️ Best Practices for Improving Security Posture:

Ensure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign least privilege access.
Monitor Compliance Recommendations in Defender for Cloud.
Enable Just-in-Time (JIT) VM Access for added security.
Set up Security Alerts & Auto-remediation policies.
🎯 Goal: Aim for a Secure Score >75% by following the security recommendations.

🔹 Part 2: Microsoft Fabric Security - Protecting Data in the Lakehouse
🎯 Step 1: Understanding Fabric Security Principles
Fabric Security Covers:
✔ Authentication – Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
✔ Authorization – Role-based access to workspaces & data.
✔ Data Protection – Encryption at rest & in transit.
✔ Network Security – Private endpoints & firewalls.

🎯 Step 2: Secure Your Fabric Lakehouse Dataflows
📌 Protecting Data in OneLake & Fabric Workspaces

✅ Control Access via Workspaces

Assign Contributor, Admin, or Viewer roles to limit data access.
✅ Use Private Endpoints for Secure Connectivity

Restrict access to trusted networks.
✅ Enable Managed Private Endpoints

This prevents unauthorized data movement to untrusted locations.
✅ Apply Row-Level & Column-Level Security

Restrict data visibility based on user roles & permissions.
✅ Monitor Data Activity with Fabric Security Logs

Set up alerts for suspicious activities in Microsoft Defender.
🏁 Final Security Checklist
