🛠️ Best Practices for Improving Security Posture:

Ensure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign least privilege access.
Monitor Compliance Recommendations in Defender for Cloud.
Set up Security Alerts & Auto-remediation policies.

🎯 Goal: Aim for a Secure Score >75% by following the security recommendations.

# 🔹 Part 2: Microsoft Fabric Security - Protecting Data in the Lakehouse

🎯 Step 1: Understanding Fabric Security Principles
Fabric Security Covers:
✔ Authentication – Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
✔ Authorization – Role-based access to workspaces & data.
✔ Data Protection – Encryption at rest & in transit.
✔ Network Security – Private endpoints & firewalls.

🎯 Step 2: Secure Your Fabric Lakehouse Dataflows
📌 Protecting Data in OneLake & Fabric Workspaces

✅ Control Access via Workspaces

Assign Contributor, Admin, or Viewer roles to limit data access.
✅ Use Private Endpoints for Secure Connectivity

Restrict access to trusted networks.
✅ Enable Managed Private Endpoints

This prevents unauthorized data movement to untrusted locations.
✅ Apply Row-Level & Column-Level Security

Restrict data visibility based on user roles & permissions.
✅ Monitor Data Activity with Fabric Security Logs

Set up alerts for suspicious activities in Microsoft Defender.
🏁 Final Security Checklist
